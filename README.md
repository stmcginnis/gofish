Gofish is a Golang library for interacting with [DMTF

## Usage ##

Basic usage would be:

package main

import (
    "fmt"

    gofish "github.com/stmcginnis/gofish/school"
)

func main() {
    c, err := gofish.APIClient("http://localhost:5000", nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    service, err := gofish.ServiceRoot(c)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    chassis, err := service.Chassis()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, chass := range chassis {
        fmt.Printf("Chassis: %#v\n\n", chass)
    }
}
```
