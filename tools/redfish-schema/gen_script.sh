# Generates a subordinate script (gen_go_source.sh) from a given schema zip
# file, finds the names of the objects, then generates go files based on
# the provided generate_from_schema.py tool and accompanying source.go file.
# Leaves the gen_go_source.sh in place for modification if needed and can be run
# independently of this script to regenerate files.

# Find the schema document name by going here:
#                                       https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish
# Inspect the url for the schema you want - for example, the 2019.1 update
# document is "DSP8010" on this page, the zip file is:
schemadoc=DSP8010_2019.1_0.zip
#
echo "Fetching schema document $schemadoc"
# We only use the zip file to get the object names. It's a little easier to
# manage.

# Generate the object list. No elegant, but it works well enough for now.
#
# SerialInterface and Switch still have some identifier issues to be worked out
# Collection files, Schedule, Protocol are "common" and included differently
# redfish-schema, odata and all the versions of each object aren't needed
#
# General process is get a list of the json-schema objects from the zip, drop
# things we don't need/want, and clip the column we want generating a file of
# object names we can use later.
